 abstract = {The paper studies how a person's concern for a future career may influence his or her incentives to put in effort or make decisions on the job. In the model, the person's productive abilities are revealed over time through observations of performance. There are no explicit output-contingent contracts, but since the wage in each period is based on expected output and expected output depends on assessed ability, an "implicit contract" links today's performance to future wages. An incentive problem arises from the person's ability and desire to influence the learning process, and therefore the wage process, by taking unobserved actions that affect today's performance. The fundamental incongruity in preferences is between the individual's concern for human capital returns and the firm's concern for financial returns. The two need be only weakly related. It is shown that career motives can be beneficial as well as detrimental, depending on how well the two kinds of capital returns are aligned.},

 abstract = {This paper studies optimal incentive contracts when workers have career concerns--concerns about the effects of current performance on future compensation. We show that the optimal compensation contract optimizes total incentives: the combination of the implicit incentives from career concerns and the explicit incentives from the compensation contract. Thus the explicit incentives from the optimal compensation contract should be strongest for workers close to retirement because career concerns are weakest for these workers. We find empirical support for this prediction in the relation between chief executive compensation and stock market performance.},

abstract = {This paper examines contract-related incentive effects using a unique dataset on individual performance and individual contracts. Evidence from professional basketball players in the 1980s and 1990s shows that individual performance improves significantly in the year before signing a multi-year contract but declines after the contract is signed. One interpretation is that workers strategically increase effort to obtain the most lucrative, multi-year contract but then reduce it once the contract is locked in. This highlights the double-edged nature of long-term contracts: good for employers when workers are fighting for them, but less so when workers have them. (JEL J22, J3)},

	abstract = {The media narrative of the ‘contract year effect’ is espoused across all major professional American sports leagues, particularly the MLB and NBA. In line with basic incentive theory, this hypothesis has been shown to be true in baseball, but the analysis in basketball to this point has been flawed. In estimating the contract year effect in the NBA, this paper is the first to define rigorously the various states of contract incentives, the ignorance of which has been a source of bias in the literature thus far. It further expands on previous analyses by measuring individual performance more broadly across a range of advanced metrics. Lastly, it attempts to account for the intrinsic endogeneity of playing in a contract year, as better players get longer contracts and are thus less likely to be in a contract year, by using exogenous variations in the NBA’s contract structure to form an instrument, and by comparing performance to a priori expectations. In this manner, this paper produces the first rigorous finding of a positive contract year phenomenon. The estimated effect is about half that found in baseball, equivalent to a 3-5 percentile boost in performance for the median player in the NBA.},

	abstract = {The empirical research on the public goods game (PGG) indicates that both institutional rewards and institutional punishment can curb free-riding and that the punishment effect is stronger than the reward effect. Self-regarding models that are based on Nash equilibrium (NE) strategies or evolutionary game dynamics correctly predict which incentives are best at promoting cooperation, but individuals do not play these rational strategies overall. The goal of our study is to investigate the dynamics of human decision making in the repeated PGG with institutional incentives. We consider that an individual’s contribution is affected by four factors, which are self-interest, the behavior of others, the reaction to rewards and the reaction to punishment. We find that people on average do not react to rewards and punishment and that self-interest and the behavior of others sufficiently explain the dynamics of human behavior. Further analysis suggests that institutional incentives promote cooperation by affecting the self-regarding preference and that the other-regarding preference seems to be independent of incentive schemes. Because individuals do not change their behavioral patterns even if they were not rewarded or punished, the mere potential to punish defectors and reward cooperators can lead to considerable increases in the level of cooperation.},

Failing to control for valid covariates can yield biased parameter estimates in correlational analyses or in imperfectly randomized experiments and contributes to underpowered analyses even in effectively randomized experiments. We introduce double-lasso regression as a principle method for variable selection. The double lasso method is calibrated to not over-select potentially spurious covariates, and simulations demonstrate that using this method reduces error and increases statistical power. This method can be used to identify which covariates have sufficient empirical support for inclusion in analyses of correlations, moderation, mediation and experimental interventions, as well as to test for the effectiveness of randomization. We illustrate both the method’s usefulness and how to implement it in practice by applying it to four analyses from the prior literature, using both correlational and experimental data.},

	abstract = {The Lasso is an attractive regularisation method for high-dimensional regression. It combines variable selection with an efficient computational procedure. However, the rate of convergence of the Lasso is slow for some sparse high-dimensional data, where the number of predictor variables is growing fast with the number of observations. Moreover, many noise variables are selected if the estimator is chosen by cross-validation. It is shown that the contradicting demands of an efficient computational procedure and fast convergence rates of the ℓ2-loss can be overcome by a two-stage procedure, termed the relaxed Lasso. For orthogonal designs, the relaxed Lasso provides a continuum of solutions that include both soft- and hard-thresholding of estimators. The relaxed Lasso solutions include all regular Lasso solutions and computation of all relaxed Lasso solutions is often identically expensive as computing all regular Lasso solutions. Theoretical and numerical results demonstrate that the relaxed Lasso produces sparser models with equal or lower prediction loss than the regular Lasso estimator for high-dimensional data.},

	abstract = {Data with a large number of variables relative to the sample size—"high-dimensional data"—are readily available and increasingly common in empirical economics. High-dimensional data arise through a combination of two phenomena. First, the data may be inherently high dimensional in that many different characteristics per observation are available. For example, the US Census collects information on hundreds of individual characteristics and scanner datasets record transaction-level data for households across a wide range of products. Second, even when the number of available variables is relatively small, researchers rarely know the exact functional form with which the small number of variables enter the model of interest. Researchers are thus faced with a large set of potential variables formed by different ways of interacting and transforming the underlying variables. This paper provides an overview of how innovations in "data mining" can be adapted and modified to provide high-quality inference about model parameters. Note that we use the term "data mining" in a modern sense which denotes a principled search for "true" predictive power that guards against false discovery and overfitting, does not erroneously equate in-sample fit to out-of-sample predictive ability, and accurately accounts for using the same data to examine many different hypotheses or models.},
