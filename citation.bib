 abstract = {The paper studies how a person's concern for a future career may influence his or her incentives to put in effort or make decisions on the job. In the model, the person's productive abilities are revealed over time through observations of performance. There are no explicit output-contingent contracts, but since the wage in each period is based on expected output and expected output depends on assessed ability, an "implicit contract" links today's performance to future wages. An incentive problem arises from the person's ability and desire to influence the learning process, and therefore the wage process, by taking unobserved actions that affect today's performance. The fundamental incongruity in preferences is between the individual's concern for human capital returns and the firm's concern for financial returns. The two need be only weakly related. It is shown that career motives can be beneficial as well as detrimental, depending on how well the two kinds of capital returns are aligned.},

 abstract = {This paper studies optimal incentive contracts when workers have career concerns--concerns about the effects of current performance on future compensation. We show that the optimal compensation contract optimizes total incentives: the combination of the implicit incentives from career concerns and the explicit incentives from the compensation contract. Thus the explicit incentives from the optimal compensation contract should be strongest for workers close to retirement because career concerns are weakest for these workers. We find empirical support for this prediction in the relation between chief executive compensation and stock market performance.},

abstract = {This paper examines contract-related incentive effects using a unique dataset on individual performance and individual contracts. Evidence from professional basketball players in the 1980s and 1990s shows that individual performance improves significantly in the year before signing a multi-year contract but declines after the contract is signed. One interpretation is that workers strategically increase effort to obtain the most lucrative, multi-year contract but then reduce it once the contract is locked in. This highlights the double-edged nature of long-term contracts: good for employers when workers are fighting for them, but less so when workers have them. (JEL J22, J3)},

abstract = {Prior work on long-term contracts and the incentive to shirk has focused almost exclusively on Major League Baseball. The current inquiry is the first to examine shirking in the National Basketball Association. We employed two different measures of player productivity. When the NBA's measure is used, we find evidence consistent with allegations of shirking behavior. But when productivity is measured in a fashion more consistent with economists' definition of marginal product, the evidence of shirking evaporates. (JEL J41, J44, L83)},

title={Show Me the Money: Examining the Validity of the Contract Year Phenomenon in the NBA}, url={https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/14398539}, abstractNote={The media narrative of the ‘contract year effect’ is espoused across all major professional American sports leagues, particularly the MLB and NBA. In line with basic incentive theory, this hypothesis has been shown to be true in baseball, but the analysis in basketball to this point has been flawed. In estimating the contract year effect in the NBA, this paper is the first to define rigorously the various states of contract incentives, the ignorance of which has been a source of bias in the literature thus far. It further expands on previous analyses by measuring individual performance more broadly across a range of advanced metrics. Lastly, it attempts to account for the intrinsic endogeneity of playing in a contract year, as better players get longer contracts and are thus less likely to be in a contract year, by using exogenous variations in the NBA’s contract structure to form an instrument, and by comparing performance to a priori expectations. In this manner, this paper produces the first rigorous finding of a positive contract year phenomenon. The estimated effect is about half that found in baseball, equivalent to a 3-5 percentile boost in performance for the median player in the NBA.}, author={Ryan, Julian}, year={2015}, month={Apr} }
